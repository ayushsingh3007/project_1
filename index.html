<body><h1><strong>Backtracking</strong></h1><br><p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p><br><p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is reoeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state, if you didn't, it isn't.</p><br>
<p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginnig with the root, you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p><br>
<p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continuethe search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of option. If you run out of the options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node.If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p><br>
<p>This needs an example</p><br>
<img src="./Image_root.png">
<ol><li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A. </li><br>
<li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br><li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br><li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
<li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
<li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
<li>At root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
<li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
<li>E is good. Congratulations!</li></ol><br>
   <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. the tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structer to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structer, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p><br> <h3><strong>The backtracking algorithm</strong></h3><br>
   <font color="blue"><pre>boolean solve(Node n) {
               if the leaf is a goal node, return true
               else return false
             } else {
           for each child c of n {
           of solve(c) succeeds,return true
         }
       return false 
     }
   }</pre></font><br>
 <p>Notice that the algorithm is expresssed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some of goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n)is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node. </p><br>
 <p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
 <ul><li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
 	<li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li></ul>
 	<p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable [part of a path to a goal node], all you have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recusively, on each child of n, in the above code, this is done by the lines.  </p><br>
             <pre> <font color="blue">   for each child c of n {
                 if solve (c) succeeds, return true
                      }
              return false
</font></pre><br>
  <P>Eventually the recusion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is goal node, it is solvable;  If the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is out base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines.</P><br>
 <pre><font color="blue"> if n is leaf node {
 if the leaf is goal node, return true 
else return false
}</font></pre><br>
<p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p><br>
<p><ul><li><strong> To search a tree:</strong></li> <ol><li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li><li>Otherwise, search the subtrees untill you find one containing a goal node, or untill you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li></ol></ul></p><br>
<p><strong>Non-recursive backstracking, using a stack</strong></p><br>
<p>Backtracking ia rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recusive algorithm can be rewritten as stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are transiated into machine or assemble language.</p><br>       <pre ><font color="blue" >boolean solve(Node n) {
            put node n on the stack; 
              if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf { 
               if it is goal node, return true
                else pop it off the stack 
     } 
       else { 
         if the node at the top of the slack has untired children 
          push the next untired child onto the stack 
           else pop the node off the stack
     }
     return false
     }</font></pre><br><p><strong>Keeping backtracking simple</strong></p><br><p>All of these version of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex:</p><br><p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solution</p><br><p>To keep the problem clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is leaf by writing a <b>game over methode</b> (or yu could even call it <b>isLeaf)</b>. This methode would encapsulate all the ugly details of figring out whether any possible moves remain.</p><br><p>Notice that backtracking algorithm require us to keep track, for each node on the currrent path, which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <strong>for each child c of n.</strong> In reality it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be  no obvious way to steo through them. In chess, for , a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?</p><br><p>The most straightforward  way to keep track of which children of the node have been trid is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that is, when you first ge there from above), make a list of all its chidren. As you try each child, take it off the list. When the list is empty; there are no remaining untried children. and you can return "failure." This is simple approach, but it may requirequite a lot of additional work. </p><br><p>There is an easier way to keep track of which chidren have been tried, if you can define an ordering of the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child yu just tried, you can determine which child to try next.</p><br><p>For example, you might be able to number the <strong> children 1 through n,</strong> and try them in mumerical order. Then, if you have hyst trued <strong> child k,</strong> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <strong> k-1,</strong> and you have not yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <strong>red first, then yellow, the green, then blue.</strong>  If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching  a maze, you can try choice in the order left, straight, right <strong>(or perhaps north, eas, south, west).</strong></p><br><p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to roder the children of a node. <strong>In the chess game example,</strong> you might number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may alse have several moves, and these must also be ordered.</p><br>
     <h4>Example: Tree Search</h4><br>
     <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible exzample of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.</p><br><p>A binary tree is a data structure composed or nodes. Once node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and or the right child. All nodes are rechable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, althoughthis is not part of the definationof a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows binary tree.  </p><br><p>Here's a defination of the BinaryTree class:</p><br><font color="blue">
<pre >public class BinaryTree {
              
               BinaryTree leftchild =null;
               BinaryTree rightChild = mull; 
               boolean isGoalNode = false;
               String name;


               BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {</pre></font>
<p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method make Tree () which constructs the above binary tree.</p><br>
<font color="blue">
  <pre>static BianryTree makeTree() {
        BinaryTree root, a,b,c,d,e,f;
        c = new BinaryTree("C",null, null, false);
        d = new Bianrytree("D", null, mull, false);
        e = new BinaryTree("E",null,null,false);
        f = new BinaryTree("F",null, mull, false);
        a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
        b = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
        root = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
        return root;
      }
      </pre></font><br>
      <p>Here's a main program to crate a binary tree and  try to solve it:</p><font color="blue">
        <pre>public static void main(String args[]) {
               BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
               System.out.printin(solvable(tree));
             }</pre></font><br>
             <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p><br><font color="blue">
              <pre>static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
                /*1*/ if (node == null) return false;
                /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                /*4*/  if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                /*5*/ return false;
                }
             </pre></font><br><p>Here what the numbered lines are doing:</p><br>
             <ol><li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is  so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without first checking whether those children actually exist.</li><li>If the node we arre given is a goal node, return success.</li><li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so,  conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null and is not a goal node, says to</li><li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><li>Since neitheer child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li><li></li></ol><br><p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p><br><p>Each time we ask for another node,  we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An alternative would be to check first each child exist, and tecur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p><br><font color="blue">
              <pre>static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node)  {
                    if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                    if (node.leftChild!=null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
                  if (node.rightChild!= null && solvable(node.rightChild))return true;
                return false;
              }</pre></font><br><p>I think first version is simpler, but  the second version is  slightly more </p><hr><br><h3>What are the children?</h3><br>
              <p>oneof the things that simplifies  the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what yu should dsdo next, as far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.</p><br><p>Consideer, for example, the problem of four-colouring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the same color.</p><br><p>To color a map, you choose a colour for the first country, then a colorfor the second country, and so on, untill all countries are colored.</p><br><p>There are two ways to do this:</p><br><ul><li>Methode1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><li>Methode 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for and adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li></ul><br><p>Let's apply of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkboard only needs two colors.</p><br><p><strong>boolean maplsOK()</strong></p><br><p>Used byh method to to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored with the given color.</p><br><p><strong>boolean oktocolor(int row, int colomn, int color)</strong></p><br><p>Used by method 2to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p><br><p><strong>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</strong></p><br><p>Used by both methodes to find the next "country" (actully, the row and column of  the next square on the checkboard).</p><br><p>Here's the code for method 1:</p><br><font color="blue">
              <pre>boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) 
                    if (row >= Num_ROWS)return maplsOK();
                    map[row][column]= color;
                    for (int nextcolor = RED; nextcolor <=BLUE;nextcolor++){
                          int[] next = nextRowAndColumn[row, column);
                          if (explore 1 (next[0], next[1], next color)) return  true;
                        }
                        return false
                      }</pre></font><br><p>And here's the code for method 2:</p><br><font color="blue"><pre>boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color){
                      if (row >= NUM_ROWSreturn true;
                     if (okToColor(row,column,color)) {
                      map[row][column]= color;
                       for (int nextcolor = RED; nextcolor <=BLUE;nextcolor++){ 
                       int[] next = nextRowAndColumn[row, column);
                       t[] next = nextRowAndColumn[row, column);
                         }
                        return false
                      }</pre></font><br><P>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise</P><br>
  <table border="1" align="center"><tr><th></th><th bgcolor="grey">2 by 3 map</th><th bgcolor="">3 by 3 map</th><th bgcolor="grey">3 by 4 map</th></tr><tr><th bgcolor="grey">Method 1:</th><td>60 ms.</td><td>940 ms.</td><td>60530 ms. (1 minute)</td></tr><tr><th bgcolor="grey">Methode 2:</th><td>0 ms.</td><td>0 ms.</td><td>0 ms.</td></tr></table><br><p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check untill a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guarnteed.  If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p><hr><br><h3>Debugging techniques</h3><br>
     <p>Often our first try at program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statement. These are some simple tricksto making effective use of print statements. These trick can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recusive routines.</p><br><p><strong>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exists.</strong></p><br><p>Often the best dubugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and wha value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exist with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p><br>
<p><strong>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging. </strong></p><br>
<p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purpose can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the result. so be very careful with it.</p><br><p>Here's our debugging code. For this trival probram, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger program the proportions will be better.</p><br>  
<font color="blue"><pre>static String indent ="";
            static String name(BinaryTree node) {
              if (node ==null) return null;
            else return node.name;
        }

      staticvvoid enter(BinaryTree node) {
       System out peintIn(indent +"Entering solvable("+ name(node) +")");
     indent = indent+"| ";
   }

     static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
     indent = indent.substring(3);
      System.out.printIn(indent = "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
      return true;
    } 


    static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
    indent = indent.sustring(3);
     System.out.printIn(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
     return false;
     }</pre></font><br>
 <p >To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p><br> 
<font color="blue"><pre>static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {
           enter(node);
           if (node == null) return no(node);
           if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
           if solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
           if solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
           return no(node);
         }</pre></font>  
         <pre> And we get these result:
                Entering solvable(Root)
                Entering solvable(A)
                Entering solvable(C)
                Entering solvable(null)
                solvable(null) returns false
                solvable(C) returns false
                Entering solvable(D)
                Entering solvable(null)
                 solvable(null) returns false
                Entering solvable(null)
                solvable(null) returns false
                solvable(D) returns false
                solvable(A) returns false
                Entering solvable(B)
                Entering solvable(E)
                solvable(E) returns true
                solvable(B) returns true
                true</pre> <br>
<p><strong> Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statement.</strong></p><br>
<p>Writing debugging statements is programing, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p> <br><br><p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p> <br><p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p><br>
<font color="blue"> 
  <pre> static final boolean debugging = false;
         
         
        static void enter(BinaryTree node) {
        if (debugging) {
           System.out.prinIn(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) +")");
            indent = indent + "| ";
          } 
        }

        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
        indent = inden.substring(3);
        System.out.printIn(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") return false");

    } 
      return false;
    }
  </pre></font><br><br><p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your code larger; mordern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be discarded.</p><br><br><p><strong>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</strong></p><br><p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptios. However, Java programing don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following code</p><br><br>
  <font color="blue"><pre>new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);</pre></font><br><p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print statement.</p><br> <font>
    <pre>java.lang.Exception:Checkpoint Charlie

<p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean . In solvable we shall need jto check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p><br>
<p>Now to the program. The main programwill initialize the board, and call a recuersive backtracking routine to attemptto solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fall, and the main program will have to pint out the bad news. </p><br><p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a blloean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p><br><p>Each possible move will result in a new board podition, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p><br><p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches wwould work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.</p><br><p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign number to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looled at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive.</p><br><p>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the made in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p><br><p><strong>Now we have a simpler ordering moves to use in out program. Just check,in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</strong></p><br><ul><li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li><li>If the position cantains a black marble, the method checksfor a move or jump to the right;</li><li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li></ul><br><br><p>We write another method <strong>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</strong> that will take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more
concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargan, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."</p><br><br><p><strong> Along with canMove and makeMove,</strong> we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.</p><font color="blue"><pre>boolean solvable(int[] board) {
